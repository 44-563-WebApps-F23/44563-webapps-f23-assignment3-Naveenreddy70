            <h1>PArroz de pato (duck rice)</h1>
            <P>Pork aside, duck rice is one of Portugals finest meat moments, a perfect marriage of succulent duck, boiled and shredded, then added to a bed of Carolino rice (made with duck stock, onions, and garlic), baked a bit, then garnished with spicy chouriço sausage and served alongside orange slices. As with so many of Portugals heartier dishes, it hails from Alentejo but was quickly adopted across the country. About 25 miles east of Porto in the small town of Louredo, you can dig into this delicacy inside the 17th-century farmhouse of Teresa Ruão, the chef behind the award-winning Cozinha da Terra. Its like eating at your grandmas house.</P>
            <h5>Reason why I like PArroz de pato (duck rice)</h5>
            <p>Arroz de Pato is an authentic Portuguese dish which has its roots in the North of Portugal, specifically the city of Braga. It combines some of the most symbolic elements of traditional Portuguese cuisine, bay leaf, garlic, wine, and of course rice.</p>
